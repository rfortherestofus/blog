## Customization of a Typst template

### Passing more parameters from Quarto to Typst

First of all, let's see how to pass any parameters from Quarto to the Typst template. Let's add an `author` parameter in our YAML:

```yaml
title: "Hello typst"
author: "Someone Fun"
format:
   typst:
      template-partials:
         - typst-template.typ
         - typst-show.typ
```

Then, we update our `typst-show.typ` file:

```{.typ filename="typst-show.typ"}
#show: body => article(
  $if(title)$
    title: [$title$],
  $endif$
  $if(author)$
    author: [$author$],
  $endif$
    body,
)
```

And then the `typst-template.typ` file:

```{.typ filename="typst-template.typ"}
#let article(
  title: "Default title",
  author: "unknown",
  body,
) = {
  align(center)[#text(size: 30pt, weight: "bold", title)]

  "The author is " + author

  body
}
```

This leads to:

## Workflow

In order to work comfortably with Typst and Quarto, you need to have a good editor and extensions. Here are the recommendations:

- Use either VS Code or Positron (RStudio does not support typst as well as those two)
- Install the following VSCode/Positron extensions:
  - [Typst LSP](https://open-vsx.org/extension/nvarner/typst-lsp)
  - [Tinymist Typst](https://open-vsx.org/extension/myriad-dreamin/tinymist)
  - [vscode-pdf](https://open-vsx.org/extension/tomoki1207/pdf)

You will have a language server (get function definitions, autocomplete, etc directly from the editor) and a code formatter (make sure your code is clean everytime you save.)

## What's next?

Now that you have the overwiew of how to work with Quarto and Typst, the next step is to learn more about Typst.

There is a great [documentation website](https://typst.app/docs/), a large community and a [forum](https://forum.typst.app/) where you can ask questions.

Typst is not fundamentally hard, but you need to spend some time working with it and reading the documentation. Also note that LLMs such as ChatGPT are **pretty bad** at Typst so it's advised to not rely on them too much.
