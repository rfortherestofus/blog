title: Customizing typst in Quarto
---

## Typst & Quarto

In the previous [blog post](#), we explained the basics of:

* how to customize typst from the Quarto yaml header
* how to use typst `set` rules for custom styling

Here we will go over how to do advanced customization such as:

* adding a footer or header
* using columns in specific areas of the report

For this, we need to create a typst template.

## Typst template

To create a template, we need to create two files: `typst-show.typ` and `typst-template.typ`.

Our project should be organized as such:

```
my_project/
├── report.qmd          # Quarto document
├── typst-show.typ      # Layer between Quarto and Typst
└── typst-template.typ  # Function of the template
```

`typst-template.typ` is the most important one. It defines the template (which is just a function) that controls the layout and style of the report. Here let us start with:

```{.typ filename="typst-template.typ"}
#let article(
  title: none,
  date: none,
  body,
) = {
  align(center)[#text(size: 30pt, title)]
  align(right)[#date]

  body
}
```

Here we define an `article()` function with three arguments:

* `title`: defaults to none
* `date`: defaults to none
* `body`: no default, because it represents all the content from our Quarto document (charts, code, markdown content, etc.)

`typst-show.typ` should look like this:

```{.typ filename="typst-show.typ"}
#show: body => article(
  title: [$title$],
  date: [$date$],
  body,
)
```

Here we are just "calling" our `article()` function from the template file.

Then, our Quarto document should explicitly mention these files with the `template-partials` flag:

````md
---
title: Hello Typst!
date: September 2025
format:
   typst:
      template-partials: 
         - typst-show.typ
         - typst-template.typ
---

## Section A

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
````

We can recognize here the centered title as well as the right-aligned date from our typst template.

## Footer

To add a footer, we need `set` rules that, [as explained in the previous blog post](#), change the behavior of a given function.

In particular, we want to change the `footer` argument, as it is the one that defines the content inside the footer. To make it simple, let us just put some very simple text in it:

```{.typ filename="typst-template.typ"}
#let article(
  title: none,
  date: none,
  body,
) = {

  set page(footer: [Text in the footer])

  align(center)[#text(size: 30pt, title)]
  align(right)[#date]

  body
}
```

![](example-2.png)

With this simple new line, now **all pages** have a footer with "Text in footer" written.

Now let us see how to make a good looking footer.

```{.typ filename="typst-template.typ"}
#let article(
  title: none,
  date: none,
  body,
) = {
  
  set page(footer: {
    rect(
      width: 100%,
      height: 0.7in,
      outset: (x: 20%),
      fill: rgb("#68ACE5"),
      align(center + horizon)[#grid(
          columns: (1fr, 1fr),
          align(left)[#text(title, fill: white, font: "Roboto")],
          align(right)[#text(date, fill: white, font: "Roboto")],
        )
      ],
    )
  })

  align(center)[#text(size: 30pt, title)]
  align(right)[#date]

  body
}
```

![](example-3.png)

This code might look complex at first but it is not. Let us read it step by step. The footer is just:

* a blue rectangle (`rect()`) that covers the full width with a height of 0.7 inches
* inside that rectangle, there is a grid (`grid()`) with two columns of the same width (`columns: (1fr, 1fr)`)
* one column is text, left aligned, with the title. The other one is right aligned, with the date.

Now what if we want to create a custom header? Well, it is **exactly the same thing**. The only thing we need to change is the `footer` argument and use `header` instead.

## Image

Now let us see how we can add an image, such as a logo, at the top of the first page.

```{.typ filename="typst-template.typ"}
#let article(
  title: none,
  date: none,
  body,
) = {

  align(left)[#text(size: 30pt, title)]
  align(left)[#date]
  place(right + top, image("oregon.svg", height: 1.4in), dy: -0.5in)

  body
}
```

![](example-4.png)

Here we combine the `place()` function with the `image()` function.

`place()` is useful to define the location of an element that is independent of other elements. A typical usage is adding a single logo image at the top of a report.

`image()` just requires a path to an image file on your computer, but here we also specify its height (width is automatically adjusted).

## Columns

#### Columns

Columns are not well supported in Quarto yet. But we can approximate the behavior by using `layout` instead.

With a Quarto document that looks like this:

````md
---
title: "Hello typst"
format:
   typst:
      template-partials:
         - typst-template.typ
         - typst-show.typ
execute:
  echo: false
---

::: {layout="[[1,1], [1]]"}
```{{r}}
print("Top left cell")
```

```{{r}}
print("Top right cell")
```

```{{r}}
print("Bottom cell")
```
:::
````

This will not be detailed in depth here as **this is not specific to Typst**. You can learn more about it [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html).

## What is next?

Now that you have an overview of how to work with Quarto and Typst, the next step is to learn how to [connect R and Typst](#) for dynamic reporting.
