If you've ever tried making high-quality PDF documents from Quarto, you know that it is a pain. 

Your first foray into this area likely involved LaTeX. Many people do make good-looking PDF documents using LaTeX, but even more succumb to its arcane syntax, throw their hands up, and give up altogether.

There is a new tool for making high-quality PDFs from Quarto. Called Typst, it describe itself as both powerful and easy to learn. Sounds promising, right!

In our consulting work as [Clarity Data Studio](https://claritydatastudio.com/), we make a lot of PDFs, like the [recent reports looking at childhood immunization made for the Johns Hopkins University International Vaccine Access Center.](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/monitoring-childhood-immunization-at-the-state-level)

Many clients come to us for support making highly-branded PDF reports, something I spoke about in my 2024 posit::conf talk [Report Design in R: Small Tweaks that Make a Big Difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp1SMhLoz_M&list=PL9HYL-VRX0oSFkdF4fJeY63eGDvgofcbn&index=30&t=1s&ab_channel=PositPBC)

In the last couple years, we've moved to Typst almost exclusively for making PDFs. Of the two promises that Typst makes (powerful and easy to learn), we agree with the first. The second, however, a bit less so. 

[The Typst website has great documentation](https://typst.app/docs/), but it mostly covers how to write directly in Typst, rather than working in Quarto and rendering with Typst. People often ask me how we make reports with Typst, but I don't have anywhere to point them to. 

So, along with consultant [Joseph Barbier](https://barbierjoseph.com/) (who has become a true expert in this area), I've put together a long blog post on how to create high-quality PDFs using Quarto and Typst.

After you've read it, hit reply and let me know what you think! I hope it's helpful in enabling others to make high-quality PDFs with Quarto and Typst. 

Cheers,
